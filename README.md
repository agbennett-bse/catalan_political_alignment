## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is define a classification technique to assign a party to Spanish Parliamentary debate speeches. 

### Methods Used

* Data Visualization
* Binary Classification

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
We used ParlaMint data on Spanish parliamentary debates from 2015-2023. We then preprocessed and applied exploratory analysis techniques. Finally, we start with left vs right parties, PP and PSOE,  then we expand our classifier to test its performance other party speeches. 

Below you can see the ability of the classifier to determine PP vs PSOE (main left and right parties in Spain), and also the trained models ability to determine the difference between VOX and Podemos (two additional more extreme parties). You can see a full write up in the pdf in this repository.
